# Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search

This subproject provides an implementation of the `SuperNet` for the modified
MnasNet search space as well as the needed `crossover` and `mutate` functions
needed for the evolution search.

The `SuperNet` and evolution functions are modeled after the paper with the title
Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling paper.
